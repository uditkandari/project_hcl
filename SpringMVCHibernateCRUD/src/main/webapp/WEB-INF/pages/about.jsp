		<h2>ABOUT COMMENT REVIEW</h2>

Due to the increasing growth in an on-line shoppings,
many Internet users find it very difficult to make decision
on their shopping needs. The users have to evaluate
many similar products with different features, quality and
prices before making a purchase decision. Unlike off-line
shopping, where the customers can assess the products
physically, the users are often relying on the promotional
images or videos to make decision.

More recently, on-line shopping websites, such as
Amazon.com, allow the Internet users to give rating for
products that are being sold on the website. The rating
will indicate the degree of satisfaction of the users for the
particular products. In addition, those websites also provide
a facilities for the users to post comments regarding the
products. Such comments can represent their opinion on
different aspects of products. Fortunately, the ratings and
comments can be used by the Internet users as additional
recommendation to help them in making purchasing
decisions.

By assuming that the ratings and comments are derived
from the experience of the user's products, other users
can make decision on how much that products will meet
their expectation based on other's experience. However,
as the number of ratings and comments for a product
increases, it becomes problematic for the users to analyze
the volume of the information. A summarization tool
is useful to help users in analyzing the information
before making decision. On the other hand, the ratings
and the comments can also be used as another method to
send feedback to the companies regarding their products.
